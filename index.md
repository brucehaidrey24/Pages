### Background
I am a first generation student in my family. My parents immigrated to the US during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan without **ANY** knowledge of the culture or even the English language, all in hopes of providing their kids with opportunities they never had. Growing up, we had many small businesses that my siblings and I had to help manage. I began working by the age of 12 and quickly had more responsibilities than any 12 year old should, and I couldn't understand why. My friends would constantly be out playing at the park or getting together after our youth basketball games to eat, but I couldn't attend, because I had to get back to work. I couldn't do anything that I felt "normal" kids my age did. I began asking myself many questions:

- Why can't I go play with my friends all the time?
- Why am I the only player on the team who has to rush home after games?
- Why do I have to be more mature than others my age?
- Why did I get put in this situation when others don't even break a sweat?
- I feel guilty to be upset because how can I be unhappy or complain when my family has given up everything for me to be here, in the US, a better situation than the one they grew up in?

I caught myself feeling sorry for myself often, but as I grew up and matured I realized all the benefits of my situation. **My biggest advantage is this, I know what it means to sacrifice for the greater good.** To truly sacrifice is the utmost act of selflessness, to really give something up for the benefit of others. I understand what's required to sacrifice because I have had to do so my whole life.


### Career Goals
At the moment, the majority of my experiences have been in the classroom. My technical depth has been trained in a multitude of ways but I have yet to scratch the surface in industry. My career goals are to apply what I've already learned, and be a sponge in the work setting to advance my abilities. I want to ship production code, have a real effect on real products, and learn from some of the most skilled engineers who I get to call coworkers.

- [x] Have an updated resume with the most recent projects I've worked on
- [x] Update my LinkedIn and Github pages
- [x] Apply for many internship positions
- [ ] Secure an internship
- [ ] Secure a job with the company I intern for
